# **What is Unsupervised Learning?**  
Unsupervised learning is a type of **machine learning** where the model is trained on an unlabeled dataset. This means the algorithm does not have predefined correct outputs (labels) and must find patterns, structures, or relationships within the data on its own.

## **Why is it Called "Unsupervised"?**  
It is called **unsupervised** because there is no direct supervision or guidance. Unlike supervised learning, where the model learns from labeled examples, unsupervised learning algorithms explore the data to find hidden structures or clusters without any explicit corrections.

## Two Main Types:  
   - **Clustering**: The algorithm groups similar data points into clusters based on their features (e.g., customer segmentation).  
   - **Dimensionality Reduction**: The algorithm reduces the number of features in a dataset while preserving important information (e.g., Principal Component Analysis).
