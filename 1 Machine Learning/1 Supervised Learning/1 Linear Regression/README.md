### What is Linear Regression?

Linear Regression is one of the simplest and most widely used machine learning algorithms. It is used to **predict a numerical value** (like house prices, exam scores, or temperature) based on one or more input features (like size of the house, hours studied, or humidity).

Think of it as drawing a straight line through data points to find the best relationship between inputs (features) and outputs (target values). <br>

It’s called **linear** because the relationship between the input ($X$) and output ($Y$) is represented by a straight line. If you have multiple input features (e.g., hours studied, sleep hours, etc.), the concept extends to higher dimensions, but the idea remains the same: finding the best-fitting "plane" or "hyperplane."  <br>


Therefore, Linear Regression is like finding the best straight line that describes how one thing (input) affects another (output). It’s simple, easy to understand, and a great starting point for learning machine learning.

### Key Idea: The Line of Best Fit

Imagine you have some data points on a graph:

- On the X-axis (horizontal), you have an input feature (e.g., "hours studied").
- On the Y-axis (vertical), you have the output (e.g., "exam score").

If you plot these points, they might look scattered. Linear Regression tries to find the **best straight line** that fits these points. This line is called the **line of best fit**.

The equation of this line looks like this:

$$
Y = mX + c
$$

Where:
- $Y$ = Predicted output (e.g., exam score)
- $X$ = Input feature (e.g., hours studied)
- $m$ = Slope of the line (how steep the line is)
- $c$ = Intercept (where the line crosses the Y-axis)

### How Does It Work?

1. **Goal**: Find the best values for $m$ (slope) and $c$ (intercept) so that the line fits the data well.
2. **Error Calculation**: The algorithm calculates how far each data point is from the line. This distance is called the **error**.
3. **Minimize Error**: The algorithm adjusts $m$ and $c$ to minimize the total error. This process is called **optimization**.

The most common method to minimize the error is called **Least Squares**, which minimizes the sum of the squared distances between the actual data points and the predicted values on the line.

### Example: Predicting Exam Scores

Let’s say you want to predict a student's exam score based on the number of hours they studied.

| Hours Studied (X) | Exam Score (Y) |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| 1                    | 50                |
| 2                    | 60                |
| 3                    | 70                |
| 4                    | 80                |

1. Plot these points on a graph.
2. Draw a straight line that best fits these points.
3. Use the equation of the line (Y = mX + c) to predict scores for new values of X (hours studied).

For example, if the line equation is Y = 10X + 40:
- If a student studies for 5 hours (X = 5), their predicted score would be: Y = 10(5) + 40 = 90

## A Tabular Example:
### **Step 1: Housing Price Dataset**
We have a dataset where we predict the **Price (in $1000s)** of a house based on its **Size (in square feet)**.

| House | Size (sq ft) | Price ($1000s) |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| A     | 1000         | 200            |
| B     | 1500         | 300            |
| C     | 2000         | 400            |
| D     | 2500         | 500            |
| E     | 3000         | 600            |

Now, we want to predict the price of a **new house with Size = 2200 sq ft** using **Linear Regression**.

---

### **Step 2: Fit the Linear Regression Model**
The linear regression equation is:  Price = β₀ + β₁ * Size


Where:
- β₀ is the intercept (the price when the size is 0).
- β₁ is the slope (how much the price changes for every 1 square foot increase in size).

We calculate the slope (β₁) and intercept (β₀) using the dataset.

---

#### Step 2.1: Calculate the Slope (β₁)
The formula for the slope is:

β₁ = Sum((xᵢ - x̄)(yᵢ - ȳ)) / Sum((xᵢ - x̄)²)


Here’s how we calculate it step by step:

1. **Find the mean of Size (x̄)**:  
   Add up all the sizes and divide by the number of houses:  


 - x̄ = (1000 + 1500 + 2000 + 2500 + 3000) / 5 = 2000


2. **Find the mean of Price (ȳ)**:  
Add up all the prices and divide by the number of houses:  


- ȳ = (200 + 300 + 400 + 500 + 600) / 5 = 400





3. **Calculate (xᵢ - x̄), (yᵢ - ȳ), and their products**:  
For each house, subtract the mean size (x̄) from its size, subtract the mean price (ȳ) from its price, and multiply these differences.

Here’s the table of calculations:

| House | Size (xᵢ) | Price (yᵢ) | xᵢ - x̄ | yᵢ - ȳ | (xᵢ - x̄)(yᵢ - ȳ) | (xᵢ - x̄)² |
|-------|-----------|------------|---------|---------|--------------------|------------|
| A     | 1000      | 200        | -1000   | -200    | 200,000            | 1,000,000  |
| B     | 1500      | 300        | -500    | -100    | 50,000             | 250,000    |
| C     | 2000      | 400        | 0       | 0       | 0                  | 0          |
| D     | 2500      | 500        | 500     | 100     | 50,000             | 250,000    |
| E     | 3000      | 600        | 1000    | 200     | 200,000            | 1,000,000  |

4. **Add up the columns**:
- Sum of (xᵢ - x̄)(yᵢ - ȳ):  
  ```
  200,000 + 50,000 + 0 + 50,000 + 200,000 = 500,000
  ```
- Sum of (xᵢ - x̄)²:  
  ```
  1,000,000 + 250,000 + 0 + 250,000 + 1,000,000 = 2,500,000
  ```

5. **Calculate the slope (β₁)**:  
Divide the sum of the products by the sum of the squared differences:  β₁ = 500,000 / 2,500,000 = 0.2



#### Step 2.2: Calculate the Intercept (β₀)
The formula for the intercept is: β₀ = ȳ - β₁ * x̄ <br>

Substitute the values:  <br>

β₀ = 400 - (0.2 * 2000) = 400 - 400 = 0 <br>



So, the intercept (β₀) is 0.



### Final Equation
The linear regression equation becomes: Price = 0 + 0.2 * Size





### Step 3: Predict the Price for a New House
For a house with **Size = 2200 sq ft**, substitute into the equation: Price = 0 + 0.2 * 2200 = 440






### Final Result:
The predicted price of the new house with **Size = 2200 sq ft** is **$440,000**.

### When to Use Linear Regression?

- When the relationship between the input(s) and output is roughly linear.
- When you need to predict a continuous numerical value (not categories like "yes/no").
- When the dataset is not too complex (for complex data, other algorithms may work better).

### experimenting with a small dataset using Python libraries like `scikit-learn`.

 a quick example:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

x = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4]])  # Hours studied
y = np.array([50, 60, 70, 80])      # Exam scores

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(x, y)

# Predict for 5 hours of study
print(model.predict([[5]]))  # Output: [90]
```

### Disadvantages of Linear Regression in Machine Learning

1. **Assumes Linearity**:  
   This is critical because linear regression fundamentally relies on the assumption of a linear relationship between variables. If the true relationship is nonlinear, the model will fail to capture the underlying patterns, leading to poor predictions and insights.

2. **Sensitive to Outliers**:  
   Outliers can significantly skew the model's parameters and predictions, making it unreliable in real-world datasets where noisy or extreme data points are common.
