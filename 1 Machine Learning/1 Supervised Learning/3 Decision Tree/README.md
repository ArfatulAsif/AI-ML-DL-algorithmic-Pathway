# **Decision Tree Algorithm**

A **Decision Tree** is a supervised learning algorithm used for both **classification** and **regression** problems. It mimics a tree-like structure, where **each internal node represents a decision**, **branches represent outcomes**, and **leaf nodes represent final predictions**.

## **How Decision Trees Work**
A Decision Tree follows these steps:

1. **Select the Best Feature:** Choose the feature that best separates the data.
2. **Split the Data:** Divide the dataset into smaller subsets based on feature values.
3. **Repeat the Process:** Recursively apply the above steps to each subset until all data points are classified.

## **Decision Tree Structure**
A Decision Tree consists of:
- **Root Node**: The first decision-making point.
- **Internal Nodes**: Intermediate decision points.
- **Branches**: Possible outcomes of a decision.
- **Leaf Nodes**: The final decision (prediction).

### **Example: Is a Person Eligible for a Loan?**
A Decision Tree can be used to predict whether a person is eligible for a loan based on factors like **income, credit score, and age**.

```
               [Income?]
                /    \
              High   Low
             /         \
       [Credit Score?]  [Reject]
        /         \
     Good       Bad
    /               \
[Approve]          [Reject]
```

- If **Income is High** and **Credit Score is Good** → **Loan Approved**
- If **Income is Low** or **Credit Score is Bad** → **Loan Rejected**

## **Advantages of Decision Trees**
✅ **Easy to interpret** – Works like a flowchart.  
✅ **Handles both categorical and numerical data.**  
✅ **No need for feature scaling (e.g., standardization or normalization).**  

## **Disadvantages**
❌ **Overfitting** – The model can become too complex.  
❌ **Biased splits** – If data is imbalanced, the tree may favor majority classes.

## **Comparison Table: Decision Tree vs. Other Algorithms**

| Algorithm          | Type                      | Pros | Cons |
|------------------|-------------------------|------|------|
| **Decision Tree** | Classification & Regression | Easy to interpret, handles mixed data types | Prone to overfitting |
| **Random Forest** | Classification & Regression | Reduces overfitting, handles missing data well | Computationally expensive |
| **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** | Classification & Regression | Works well with high-dimensional data, effective for complex decision boundaries | Slow for large datasets, requires tuning of kernel parameters |
| **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** | Classification & Regression | Simple, works well for small datasets | Computationally expensive, sensitive to noisy data |
| **Linear Regression** | Regression | Simple and interpretable | Only works for continuous data |
| **Logistic Regression** | Classification | Works well for binary classification | Assumes linear decision boundary |
