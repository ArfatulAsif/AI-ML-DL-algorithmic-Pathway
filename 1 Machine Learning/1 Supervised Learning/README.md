# **What is Supervised Learning?**  
Supervised learning is a type of **machine learning** where the model is trained on a labeled dataset. This means that for each input, there is a corresponding correct output (label), and the model learns to map inputs to outputs by minimizing the error.

## **Why is it Called "Supervised"?**  
It is called **supervised** because the learning process is similar to how a teacher supervises students. The algorithm learns from **training data with correct answers (labels)** and adjusts itself to improve accuracy. The model makes predictions, and if they are incorrect, it gets corrected based on the labeled data.



## Two Main Types:
   - **Classification**: Output is descrete or catagorical values (e.g., Yes/No, 0, 1, 2).
   - **Regression**: Output is continuous values (e.g., house price prediction).
