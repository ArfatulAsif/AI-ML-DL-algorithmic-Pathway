## üîç 8. Interpretability & Explainability (Optional)

- [x] **Feature importance**: Can be estimated using techniques like permutation importance, but it's not a direct output of the model.
- [ ] **Visualizations (e.g., decision boundary)**: Generally not feasible for high-dimensional data as the boundary is too complex to visualize.
- [x] **SHAP / LIME**: Yes, these are the standard model-agnostic tools used to explain individual predictions from "black box" models like FNNs.

**Can a non-expert understand its outputs?**
The final prediction (e.g., "This is a cat") is easy to understand. However, FNNs are considered **"black box" models**, meaning the reasoning *why* it made that decision is not inherently clear. Explaining the model's logic requires specialized tools like SHAP or LIME.

## üìà 9. Use Cases & When to Avoid

**Ideal use cases:**
-   Complex classification and regression problems on **structured/tabular data**.
-   When predictive performance is more important than model interpretability.
-   As a strong baseline model for more complex deep learning tasks.

**When to avoid:**
-   When model **interpretability** is a critical requirement.
-   For very small datasets, as FNNs have many parameters and can easily overfit.
-   For data with strong spatial patterns (images) or sequential patterns (time series, text), where specialized architectures are far more effective.

**Alternatives to consider:**
-   For tabular data: **Gradient Boosting Machines** (XGBoost, LightGBM).
-   For interpretability: **Linear/Logistic Regression**, **Decision Trees**.
-   For images: **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.
-   For sequence data: **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** or **Transformers**.
