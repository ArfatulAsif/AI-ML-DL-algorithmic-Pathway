# üß™ 6. Model Fitness / Training Behavior (YOLO)

### ‚ùì**What is the loss function in YOLO?**

YOLO‚Äôs loss is **composite**, meaning it's a combination of multiple objectives. Unlike FNNs which usually deal with just one (like crossentropy or MSE), YOLO needs to:

‚úÖ Detect the object
‚úÖ Localize it (i.e., where it is)
‚úÖ Classify it correctly
‚úÖ Be confident about it
‚úÖ And not hallucinate objects where there are none.

So the total loss is:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{YOLO}} = \lambda_{coord} \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{bbox}} + \lambda_{obj} \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{obj}} + \lambda_{noobj} \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{noobj}} + \lambda_{cls} \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{cls}}
$$

### üîç Breakdown:

| Component       | What It Does                                                                            | Loss Type               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| üü¶ `bbox loss`  | Predicts the **center (x, y)** and **width-height (w, h)** of bounding boxes accurately | **MSE / CIoU / GIoU**   |
| ‚úÖ `obj loss`    | Predicts **whether there is an object** in a bounding box                               | **Binary crossentropy** |
| ‚ùå `noobj loss`  | Penalizes false positives (boxes that predict something when nothing is there)          | **Binary crossentropy** |
| üè∑ `class loss` | Predicts the **correct class** of the object inside the box                             | **Crossentropy**        |

### üß† **What can you check to diagnose model fitness?**

* [x] **Total loss curve:** Always watch the **total loss** AND its components ‚Äî especially `bbox`, `obj`, and `cls`. A decrease in all = good.
* [x] **Bounding box behavior:** Watch sample predictions ‚Äî are the boxes centered? Too small/large? Overlapping?
* [x] **Confidence map:** Check if the model becomes **overconfident** in the wrong places (high scores for empty regions = bad).
* [x] **Underfitting:** High and flat loss across all components = model isn‚Äôt learning.
* [x] **Overfitting:** Validation loss (esp. classification) increases while training loss keeps decreasing = classic overfit.

| Diagnostic                 | What to Look For                                |

| üß± **Predicted boxes**     | Are boxes tightly fit? Too many? Too few?       |
| üìå **Confidence heatmap**  | Are object scores concentrated only on objects? |
| üéØ **Label/pred mismatch** | Overlay GT (ground truth) with predictions      |

# üìä 7. Evaluation Metrics (YOLO)

YOLO isn't just classification ‚Äî it's **object detection**. So our metrics must handle **localization + classification**.
