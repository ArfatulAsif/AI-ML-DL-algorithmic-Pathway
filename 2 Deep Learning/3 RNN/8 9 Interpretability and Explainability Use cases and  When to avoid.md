### 📍 8. Interpretability & Explainability (Optional)

- [x] **Feature importance**: Can be estimated using permutation importance or SHAP.
- [ ] **Visualizations (e.g., decision boundary)**: Not feasible for high-dimensional NLP.
- [x] **SHAP / LIME**: These are standard tools to explain black-box models like RNNs.

### 🧠 LIME vs SHAP (for RNNs)

| Feature / Question               | 🟨 LIME                                    | 🟩 SHAP                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| 🎯 Goal                          | Explain one prediction with a simple model | Fairly distribute prediction to features  |
| ⚙️ Uses your actual model?       | ✅ For predictions only                     | ✅ Fully for both prediction & explanation |
| 🧠 Builds its own model?         | ✅ Yes (for local explanation)              | ❌ No                                      |
| 📍 Local or Global?              | Only Local                                 | Both Local and Global                     |
| 💬 Output                        | Rough estimate of feature effects          | Exact, fair feature contributions         |
| 📊 Stability                     | May vary between runs                      | Always consistent                         |
| ⚡ Speed                          | Fast                                       | Slower (especially with many features)    |
| 🧠 Handles feature interactions? | ❌ Not well                                 | ✅ Yes                                     |
| 🧪 Works with any model?         | ✅ Fully model-agnostic                     | ✅ Mostly (TreeSHAP, DeepSHAP for speed)   |
| 📈 Global feature importance?    | ❌ Not available                            | ✅ Yes                                     |
| 🧩 Best for                      | Quick debugging, exploratory analysis      | High-stakes decisions, trust, fairness    |

### 🔍 Example — RNN Sentiment Classifier

**Input:**
```text
"The movie was boring and too long."
```

**Prediction:** ❌ Negative (Sentiment = 0)

#### 🟨 LIME Output Example:
| Word         | Impact on Prediction |
|--------------|----------------------|
| boring       | -0.45                |
| too long     | -0.35                |
| movie        | +0.10                |

> LIME says: The word "boring" contributed most to predicting a negative sentiment.

#### 🟩 SHAP Output Example:
| Word         | SHAP Value (↓ Positivity) |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| boring       | -0.42                      |
| long         | -0.27                      |
| great        | +0.30                      |

> SHAP shows each word’s fair share of influence in increasing/decreasing the output.

### 📌 9. Use Cases & When to Avoid (RNN)

**Ideal Use Cases:**
- Natural language tasks (sentiment analysis, translation, summarization)
- Sequential sensor/time-series data
- When sequence or context matters

**Avoid RNN When:**
- Dataset is too small → RNN can easily overfit
- Low-latency applications → RNNs can be slow
- Long sequences → Use Transformer instead

**Alternatives:**
- Tabular data: Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
- Vision: CNNs
- Long-term dependencies or scaling: Transformers
